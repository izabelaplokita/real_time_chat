Real time web using Express, Socket.io and MongoDB


You need to have mongoDB installed and running
Add --dbpath attribute with the path to the /data folder in this project while running mongo
(e.g. I am using Windows and this project is in Downloads directory, then I will run CMD, go where the mongod.exe is and run:
mongod.exe --dbpath C:\Users\iza\Downloads\real_time_chat-master\data

In another window in the project directory:
Then (atter installing all dependencies with 'npm install') run: 'node index.js' and visit 'http://localhost:3700/'
